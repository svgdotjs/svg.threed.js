# svg.threed.js
An SVG.js plugin to visualise 3D scenes and objects

## Important
This is nowhere near a finished product, just a proof of concept. It features:
- ability to configure perspective
- depth of field based on the position of verteces on the z-axis
- a basic collada parser
- ability to render verteces and edges in different color schemes

It needs:
- ability to draw faces
- implementation of the normals
- camera's to rotate the view (now the object is rotated around its centre)
- lights
- and many things more!
